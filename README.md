# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis and Visualization

## Introduction
Welcome to the Electric Vehicle Data Analysis and Visualization project! This project aims to provide insights into electric vehicle (EV) usage, adoption trends, charging infrastructure, and other relevant factors through data analysis and visualization techniques. Whether you're an EV enthusiast, a policymaker, or a researcher, this project offers tools and resources to explore and understand the landscape of electric mobility.

## Features
- **Data Import**: Import raw electric vehicle data from various sources such as government databases, charging networks, or user-generated platforms.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform exploratory analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conduct statistical tests and analyses to gain deeper insights into EV usage patterns, charging behavior, geographical distribution, etc.
- **Data Visualization**: Create informative and visually appealing charts, graphs, and maps to present the findings effectively.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Utilize geospatial analysis techniques to visualize EV charging station locations, coverage areas, and accessibility.

## Installation
To get started with the Electric Vehicle Data Analysis and Visualization project, follow these steps:
